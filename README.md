**King's Conquest** is a chess roguelike game, where you advance through several randomly generated floors until you reach floor 12 where you must defeat the enemy king. The game was made during [7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2023](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2023).

The game was made using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) and the source code is a glorious spaghetti mess full of last minute changes.
